# ML_from_scratch
Machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in numpy

### Convolutional Neural Networks:
Project file: firstCNN.py

Description:

Implemented simple CNN to predict whether the face represented as a numpy array is smiling, frowning, or neutral. Additionally we can check the filters after training and see that they have an interpretable state (curves that help with classify frowns or smiles).
At the end of firstCNN.py there are 3 arrays (face1, face2, face3), feel free to change around the faces and see if it still generalizes to predict them correctly. (Keep in mind that if someone other than you can barely classify the emotion, the network will probably have trouble too)
